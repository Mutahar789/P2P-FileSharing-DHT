# P2P-FileSharing-DHT
Implementation of a resilient P2P file sharing system using Distributed Hash Table and consistent hashing, featuring node failure tolerance.

## Features
- Custom implementation of Distributed Hash Table using consistent hashing.
- File sharing capabilities with `put()` and `get()` operations.
- Node failure tolerance and seamless handling of node joins and leaves.

## Testing
The system is tested using various scenarios, including corner cases for single and dual-node networks.
